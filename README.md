## 🏛️ Key Architecture

### 🧠 The Neural Engine
Powered by OpenRouter/LLM integration, ApexLedger doesn't just log trades—it understands them.
- **Automated Tagging**: Real-time pattern recognition and session-based tagging.
- **Sentiment Synthesis**: AI analysis of your trade notes to identify psychological bias.
- **Neural Checklists**: Dynamically generated, strategy-specific checklists to ensure discipline.
- **Strategy Scoring**: Objective AI evaluation of trades based on your predefined blueprints.

### 🗺️ The Neural Map (3D)
Visualize your trading edge in three dimensions. Using `Three.js` and `react-force-graph-3d`, your strategies are rendered as an interactive neural network, allowing you to explore the connections between variables, triggers, and execution logic.

### 📝 Institutional Core Blueprints
A sophisticated, block-based strategy editor inspired by Notion.
- **Institutional Canvas**: Design complex strategies with rich text, images, and logic blocks.
- **Blueprint-to-Checklist**: One-click conversion of strategy logic into executable neural checklists.
- **Synthesis Engine**: Bridge the gap between theory and execution.

### 📊 Performance Analytics
- **Professional Metrics**: Profit Factor, R-Multiple distribution, Win/Loss ratios, and Max Drawdown.
- **Equity Curve**: Dynamic visualization of your capital growth over time.
- **Calendar Heatmaps**: Identify your most (and least) profitable sessions and days.

### 🧪 Backtesting 2.0
- **Simulation Mode**: Replay past price action and execute trades in a controlled environment.
- **Direct Journaling**: Seamlessly import backtested sessions into your primary journal for comparison.
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Built-in adapters for Forex, Crypto, and major indices.
